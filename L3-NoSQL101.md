#Lesson - 3  Comparing NoSQL terms with Relational Database

- If you are using nosql database first time like me, this note is for you.

- `Document` : Like a `Row`(or `Record`) in relational database.

- `Field` : Like `Column` in relational database. Since we don't have schema in nosql databases, so every ducument might have totally different filed. There are `key` and `value` in a filed. Like this: `{key: value}`
